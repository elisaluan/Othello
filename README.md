# Othello
My Grade 11 ICS project about developing the game Othello using Java with the theme of WeBareBears

The objective of the game is to 'flank' the enemy and gain as much territory as possible.

You are able to click on squares that are adjacent within a 3x3 area around a single square that has
already been claimed (or already has icon on it).

To 'flank' an enemy, on a single line, whether it be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, as long
as one end of the line and the other end of line are of the same type (otherwise, belonging to
the same player), then every square space in between the two ends now belong to the flanking player.

Eventually, the board will fill such that each square in the grid. At this point, the winner of the
round will be determined. The player who wins is the person with the most territory (or squares).

The game is meant to have all files included in a folder, with the main .java files compiled and to be RUN from the: 
		OthelloGUI.java class

Enjoy!
